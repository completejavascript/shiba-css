## Shiba.CSS Framework

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A simple and lightweight CSS Framework built with Sass for building responsive web apps.

## Modification

Shiba.CSS is written by Sass. So you can easily modify it with your own style. Firstly, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/completejavascript/shiba-css.git
cd shiba-css
```

Then, run the project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In the project, I define all variables in `src/base/_variables.scss`. You can customize the style by changing their values.

After changing, you can navigate to `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to see what you make changes.
