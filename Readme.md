A simple and lightweight CSS Framework built with Sass for building responsive web apps.

## Usage

- [Download the stylesheet](https://completejavascript.github.io/shiba-css/css/shiba.min.css) or use the CDN URL: [https://unpkg.com/shiba-css@1.0.0/docs/css/shiba.min.css](https://unpkg.com/shiba-css@1.0.0/docs/css/shiba.min.css).

- Save the stylesheet and link to it in the head of your project.

## Modification

Shiba.CSS is written by Sass. So you can easily modify it with your own style. Firstly, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/completejavascript/shiba-css.git
cd shiba-css
```

Then, run the project:

```bash
yarn dev # npm run dev
```

In the project, I define all variables in `src/base/_variables.scss`. You can customize the style by changing their values.

After changing, you can navigate to `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser to see what you make changes.

And distribution files can be found at `docs/css/shiba.min.css`.
